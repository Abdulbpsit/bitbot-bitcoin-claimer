Make sure your account doesn’t have to solve captcha for every roll. If it does, contact me for the script that can also solve the captchas.

Insert your account’s cookies in line 14. Setup a database (I used MongoDB) to get updates on your bot. I’m running this bot on an Ubuntu Server. 

Use a 256MB/512MB ram server for best investment/profit ratio. I'm using the free Azure Server credits that I redeemed by using my education email.
